# üìΩÔ∏è webm-simple-batch-convertor
When executed, this `.bat` file checks a folder for videos, uses HandbrakeCLI to convert them to .webm VP9, and handles failures, with basic reporting.

## Description
This is a `.bat` file which, when executed:
  1. checks "C:\Videos\To Be Converted\" for files
    - if no files are found, prints a message "No more files found to convert"; reports basic statistics
    - else, continues with the next steps
  1. converts the oldest file in the folder using `handbrakecli -i "input.mp4" -o "output.webm" -f av_webm -O -e VP9` where `input.mp4` is the name of the input filename (`*.*`), and `outout.webm` is the same filename prefix with the `.webm` suffix
  1. upon a successful convert, moves the converted file to  `C:\Videos\Converted\`
  1. upon a successful convert, moves the input file to `C:\Videos\Successful\`
  1. upon an unsuccessful convert, moves the input file to `C:\Videos\Failed\`
  1. loops back to the top
